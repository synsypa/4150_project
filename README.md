4. Perform a regression of the log-return on time.

## For 2 Selected Stocks:
1. Test the equality of the two population means.
2. Perform a regression of one log-return on the other
  * All regression output needs to include intercept and slope estimates
  * A diagram of the data with the least-squares line,
  * A graphical depiction of residuals
