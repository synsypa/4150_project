# 4150 Project - Shiny App
Using Interday Log Returns of 10 Energy Stocks

## For Each Stock:
1. Display histograms for your data by stock symbol.
2. Display a normal probability plot.
3. Create (approximate) confidence intervals for the means and variances given a user-specified confidence level.
4. Perform a regression of the log-return on time.

## For 2 Selected Stocks:
1. Test the equality of the two population means.
2. Perform a regression of one log-return on the other
  * All regression output needs to include intercept and slope estimates
  * A diagram of the data with the least-squares line,
  * A graphical depiction of residuals
  * R2

## Additional Plots (NOT YET IMPLEMENTED)
1. Average Returns by Variance Scatter
 * Whole Sample
 * By Sector
 * By Season
2. Integrate Market Cap, Beta
